# Sailboat Web-Scraper
This is just my attempt at creating a simple web scraper. I wanted to try it out because I would like to build a scraper which can find stock market data for use in a future project.

It just srapes over the [Yacht World Listings Page](https://www.yachtworld.com/boats-for-sale/type-sail/) and returns an object which could then be filtered or sorted based on price, brand, etc..

## About
The project was created with Typescript.
